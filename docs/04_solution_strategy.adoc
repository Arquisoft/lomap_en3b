=== Technology decisions
* Implement LoMap in mainly a React framework with a Express server. React is a really suitable framework for the use of pods and also for the developing of one page applications.
* Javascript: The programming language we chose was Javascript as none of us had any experience with neither Javascript or Typescript and we thought the learning curve of the first one could be a bit easier to deal with.


=== Decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system
* Do not have a database: During the development process we found ourselves not needing a centralised database.
This is mainly because our top quality goal was privacy and to get such goal the use of the pods to store every piece of information of the user was the best approach in our eyes.
It keeps the information of the user decentralised and at their disposal at all times.
* This makes our application mainly client-side, with a server using just express.
* No REST API needed.

=== Decisions about Region-specific map view.
In accordance with the original vision for LoMap, which aimed to provide citizens with personalised maps of places and
local businesses in their city, we made the decision to initially limit the app's functionality to only allow users to
add locations within a specific city or region. This was done to ensure that the app aligned with its intended purpose
and catered specifically to the needs of local citizens.

However, we understand that there may be a need to expand the
app's scope in the future, and we remain open to exploring options for extending its reach beyond a single city or region.

The feature we added to show the specific region and the places added by them or their friends directly on the map
is an example of how we prioritized usability and user experience in our app development. By this, we aimed to enhance
the user's overall experience by reducing the effort required to find relevant locations on the map.

This feature improves the user interface's efficiency and responsiveness by showing the most relevant information right
away, leading to increased user satisfaction and engagement. Overall, our focus on usability and user experience aligns
with the quality attributes of usability, accessibility, and responsiveness, which are essential for modern web applications.

=== Asynchronous Programming to Improve User Experience
The decision to introduce asynchronous programming in LoMAP is a crucial one, with the potential to significantly
improve the user experience. Asynchronous programming allows the application to execute multiple tasks simultaneously,
without blocking the user interface, resulting in faster and more responsive applications.



=== Decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* Use Google Maps API regarding the maps of the application. Brings us a nice infrastructure regarding every location aspect of the application we could need.
* Use the corresponding APIs in order to establish proper connection with the pods.

=== Relevant organizational decisions
* Use of git workflow regarding version control. This way we can have a great amount of control over the versioning and updating of the code when developing the application.
* Constant review and update of the projects documentation in order to develop an easy to understand application for other developers (not only potential users).
* Delegate in the solid provider all the possible actions related to the pods, such as login, management of the adding and removing of friends or the users' own profile.

.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the system's architecture. These include

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanation of these key decisions short.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way,
based upon your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints.
