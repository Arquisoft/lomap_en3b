== Quality Requirements


[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.

=== Quality Tree

[role="arc42help"]

.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios




|===
 |**Quality Requirement**|**Scenario**|**Priority**
 |Responsiveness|The application needs to have a fast response time. Any user should be able to use the features of the app with no major problems and without having noticeable delays on response times.|High
 |Maintainability|All of the code should be written in such a way that it can be easily modified and reused. Also, it is important that any errors or bugs can be easily fixed.LoMap will be developed minding the readability of its code and documentation.|High
 |Security|The user's data will be saved and retrieved from a secured pod. We want the users to trust our application with their private data.|High
 |Usability|Our application will be easy to use for all types of users. It should be easy to understand and performing all the wanted actions shouldn't raise any problems.|Medium
 |Privacy|The user will have the option to choose with who he wants to share his data with.|Medium

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe  your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.
