== Introduction and Goals
LoMap is an application designed for citizens in order to allow them to personalize their city map.

For that matter , users of LoMap will be allowed to do such things as leaving reviews of establishments, monuments or any other place of the city; as well as pinning those places they want to visit or have visited already.

LoMap will also be a tool for establishment owners to boost their businesses digitally by allowing them to have their own space on the map.

In brief, LoMap is more than a Map application , but a tool for cities to develop and offer their best to anybody that is interested in visiting them. Powered by its own inhabitants honest opinions, the city will open itself to outlanders allowing them to know places they probably would have never reached.

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged â€¦

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.
