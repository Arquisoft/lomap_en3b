== Runtime View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

****

_All runtime scenarios where developed based on the http://solid.georgetown.domains/technical-component/[SOLID project documentation_]

=== <Runtime Scenario 1 - User login>

* The user logs into LoMap, by using his POD credentials.
** Credentials will be validated by making a petition to the POD provider (INRUPT) api
*** LoMap checks the session's Login status.
    **** If the data is correct, a new session will be started, and lomap will display the user's map.
    **** In case the data is not found, user will be notified. No session will start.

=== <Runtime Scenario 2 - User adds private elements to the map>
Location Addition Deletion & Updating will work in a similar way architecture-wise. In general terms, the process will be the following :

    * Petition to the Inrupt api using the POD's ID.

    * Inrupt api will communicate with the pod, depending on the endpoint, it will ask the pod to add, update , delete or just retrieve information.

    * In case of addition/deletion/update , LoMap will ask the POD to return the updated data (through Inrupts api)

    * Once LoMap receives the updated data, the map will be rendered again.

_Below, a sequence diagram for Additions it's provided_

_For the sake of simplicity, friend's locations CRUD & display will be covered in an independent runtime scenario._

=== <Runtime Scenario 4 -Privacy levels >
LoMap will provide the users with** TWO privacy levels at the moment**:

    * *Friends-Only* posts will _only_ be displayed to _their contacts_

    * *Private* contributions will appear _to the creator only._

In *further stages,* a new privacy level will be implemented:

* *Public* contributions to the map will be shown to _any_ user.


*The references to Friend  users are stored in the Pod*

 * That means that, to display friend content, a petition to the pod will be made to ask for the set of friends of a user.

    **  LoMap will retrieve the locations set as friend-only  by each contact from the pod and then add them to the user's personal rendered map.
