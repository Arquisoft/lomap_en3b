== Architecture Constraints
[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
=== 2.1 Technical constraints
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| _Maps should be under full control of the users_ | _One of the main focuses of the application is the user, therefore all the maps created and personalized by them should be under their full control._
| _Use of pods_ | _Following with the users' focus, all the shared information by them should be stored in their corresponding personal pods according to the SOLID project, guaranteeing their real ownership of such information._
| _Web application_ | _LoMap is mainly a web application, making it easy for most if not all users to use and access the application._
| _Generic software solution_ | _The idea is to develop a generic solution that could be deployed in any city needed, not just an exclusive solution to one city._
| _GitHub_ | _Use of a repository regarding version control._
|===
=== 2.2 Organizational constraints
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| _Budget_ | _The team is not getting any budget whatsoever, so if there is a need to pay for something, it will run on the members of the team._
| _Delivery deadlines_ | _There are 4 deliverables every 3 weeks that should be followed accordingly before the deployment of the application._
|===
=== 2.3 Conventional constraints
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| _ARC42_ | _Documentation format must follow the ARC42 standards._
| _English_ | _The project must be developed in such language._

.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
