|Constraint|Explanation|Type
| _Maps should be under full control of the users_ | _One of the main focuses of the application is the user, therefore all the maps created and personalized by them should be under their full control._| Technical
| _Use of pods_ | _Following with the users' focus, all the shared information by them should be stored in their corresponding personal pods according to the SOLID project, guaranteeing their real ownership of such information._| Technical
| _Web application_ | _LoMap is a Full Stack web application, therefore should be composed of both a front-end and a back-end layer, making it easy for most if not all users to use the application._| Technical

| _Delivery deadlines_ | _There are 4 deliverables every 3 weeks that should be followed accordingly before the deployment of the application._ | Organizational

.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
